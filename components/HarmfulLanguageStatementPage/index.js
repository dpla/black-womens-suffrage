          <h2>Materials in this collection and the language that describes them may be harmful.</h2>
          <p>Libraries and archives collect materials from different cultures and time periods to preserve and make available the historical record. As a result, library materials, such as those presented here, may reflect racist and misogynoir views that may be harmful and difficult to view.</p>
          <p>The content featured in this collection explores linkages between Black women’s suffrage and other social causes of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries (anti-slavery, anti-lynching, education reform and civil rights) as well as racism within the Suffrage Movement. These materials are presented here to recognize and celebrate the important contributions of Black women and their resiliency in the face of ongoing racism and exclusion.</p>

            <dd>
              Digital Public Library of America collects and makes freely available materials from thousands of
              libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural heritage organizations across the United States.
              Each institution or contributor shares materials with the DPLA according to its specific policies and
              objectives.

            <dt>Why does this potentially harmful content exist?</dt>
            <dd>The Black Women’s Suffrage Collection includes depictions and records of people experiencing trauma
            and
            harm. These materials are collected and preserved as part of the American historic record.
            Librarians
            and archivists must balance preservation of this history with sensitivity to how it is presented to
            users.

            <dd>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Librarians and archivists choose what language to use when
                  describing materials. Some of these descriptions were written
                  many years ago, using language that was accepted at the time.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Librarians and archivists often re-use language provided by
                  creators or former owners of the material. This can provide
                  important context, but can also reflect biases and prejudices.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Librarians and archivists often use a standardized set of terms,
                  such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings, to describe
                  materials. Some of these terms are outdated, offensive, or insensitive.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Communities with less access to and privilege within libraries and
                  archives have had less control over how they are represented and
                  described.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Librarians and archivists sometimes make mistakes or use poor
                  judgement.
                </li>

                <li>
                  DPLA is committed to working with its partners to assess and
                  update descriptions that are harmful.

                  Revising descriptions and standardized sets of descriptive terms,
                  such as Library of Congress Subject Headings, supplementing
                  description with more respectful terms, or creating new
                  standardized terms to describe materials.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Researching the problem, listening to users, experimenting with

                <li>
                  DPLA will forward your report to the institution(s) that are
                  responsible for the content and make it available through DPLA. It
                  is up to each individual institution to determine whether or not they
                  will change or remove the content. Institutions weigh potential
                  harm against considerations such as accurate preservation of the
                  historical record, professional best practices, and allocation of
                  scarce resources.
                </li>

                <li>
                  DPLA will use all reports of harmful content to better understand
                  the issue and educate other librarians and archivists.
