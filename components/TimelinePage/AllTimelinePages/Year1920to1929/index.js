          <p>The 19th Amendment becomes law, giving women the right to vote. <SearchTag label="National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA)" tag="blackwomensuffrage_national_american_women_suffrage_association"/> disbands and many white women join the new nonpartisan <Link href='/search?q="league+of+women+voters"'><a>League of Women Voters</a></Link>. However, many Black women in the South continued to face significant obstacles, already put in place by racist white officials to limit Black men's voting rights, to actually casting their ballots.</p>
          <p>Presidential candidate Warren Harding solicits the support of Black women through northern Black women's groups and national Black women's organizations. Black women, including <SearchTag label="Lethia C. Fleming" tag="blackwomensuffrage_lethia_cousins_fleming"/>, <SearchTag label="Mary Church Terrell" tag="blackwomensuffrage_mary_church_terrell"/> and Bertha Higgins, are employed by the Republican National Committee to join his campaign on the national, state and local levels. Fleming wrote an open letter to Black women urging them to vote for Harding. He was not, however, endorsed by the <SearchTag label="National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACW)" tag="blackwomensuffrage_national_association_of_colored_women"/>, the largest Black women's organization in the United States. Although an endorsement elicited fierce debate, many NACW members chose to withhold support due to the Republican party's failure to take a strong position against lynching.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Edward Washington runs for a seat on the Haddonfield, New Jersey, school board (Terborg-Penn, 148).</p>
          <p>Annie Simms Banks is appointed to Kentucky's Republican convention; she is the first southern Black woman to be selected for a political party convention (Terborg-Penn, 150).</p>
          <p>Mrs. W.L. Preston, of Seattle, Washington, unsuccessfully runs for the Washington state senate; she is believed to be the first Black woman to run for a state legislature seat. She runs on an anti-discrimination platform that included equal pay for equal work; child labor reform; increased widow's pensions; and free tuition to state universities for the children of taxpayers (Terborg-Penn, 149).</p>
          <p>Grace Campbell of New York City runs as a Socialist for a seat in the New York State Assembly (Terborg-Penn, 149).</p>
          <p><SearchTag label="National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)" tag="blackwomensuffrage_naacp"/> branches in Alabama, Georgia, Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma and New York organize voter education classes for Black women.</p>
          <p>In states like Alabama, Georgia, Maryland, Florida, Tennessee and Texas, where Black women face white opposition to their registration as voters, Colored Women's Leagues are formed to help Black women with the registration process. They had particular success in Baltimore, Savannah, Atlanta, Jacksonville and in the state of Tennessee (Terborg-Penn, 150).</p>
          <p>Georgia State Representative Thomas H. Bell predicts that the 19th Amendment would dismantle white supremacy in Georgia because of the votes of Black women. He urges white women to vote to counteract the votes of Black women (Terborg-Penn, 152).</p>
          <p>Thirty-two women in Columbia, South Carolina, sue the local registrar who attempted to deny them the ability to register to vote. Efforts to block Black women from voting were also reported in other areas of South Carolina, as well as Virginia and North Carolina.</p>
          <p><SearchTag label="W.E.B. DuBois" tag="blackwomensuffrage_w_e_b_debois"/> warns that the South will try to disenfranchise Black women, and urges them to resist (Terborg-Penn, 152).</p>
          <p>The NAACP presents evidence to Congress of discrimination against Black women voters, as part of an unsuccessful effort to pass a bill limiting representation of states who discriminate against women voters (Terborg-Penn, 154).</p>
          <p>Lethia C. Fleming serves as head of the Republican National Committee's Black Woman's Advisory Committee for the 1920 presidential election.</p>

          <p>At the annual convention of the League of Women Voters (formerly NAWSA), Black women try to raise the problem of disenfranchisement. Southern white women attempt to block the discussion, and in the end the League refuses to take action. The <SearchTag label="National Women's Party" tag="blackwomensuffrage_national_womans_party"/> and Alice Paul also refuse to see the intersections of race and gender playing out in Black women's disfranchisement. Instead, Paul claims disenfranchisement is a race issue and not a women's issue (Terborg-Penn, 155).</p>
