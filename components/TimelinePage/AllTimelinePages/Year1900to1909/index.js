          <p>The annual meeting of the <SearchTag label="General Federation of Women's Clubs" tag="blackwomensuffrage_general_federation_of_womens_clubs"/> is held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Suffragist <SearchTag label="Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin" tag="blackwomensuffrage_josephine_st_pierre_ruffin"/> wanted to attend the meeting as the delegate from her Woman's Era Club, but the organizers refused as the club was a Black organization, and one white woman reportedly even ripped Ruffin's membership badge from her dress. Rather than attend as a delegate from one of the mostly white groups of which she was also a member, Ruffin refused to attend altogether. What became known as the "Ruffin incident" was widely covered in newspapers nationwide, with most coverage sympathetic to Ruffin.</p>
          <p>At the <SearchTag label="National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA)" tag="blackwomensuffrage_national_american_women_suffrage_association"/> convention, <SearchTag label="Mary Church Terrell" tag="blackwomensuffrage_mary_church_terrell"/> speaks: "When one observes how all the most honorable and lucrative positions in Church and State have been reserved for men, according to laws which they themselves have made so as to debar women; how, until recently, a married woman's property was under the exclusive control of her husband...These unjust discriminations will ever remain until the source from which they spring--the political disenfranchisement of woman—shall be removed. The injustice...extends to the nation as well, in that it is deprived of the excellent service which woman might render." She went on, "The elective franchise is withheld from one half of its citizens…because the word 'people,' by an unparalleled exhibition of lexicographical acrobatics, has been turned and twisted to mean all who were shrewd and wise enough to have themselves born boys instead of girls, or who took the trouble to be born white instead of black." This latter part of Terrell's remarks were not included in the record of the convention.</p>
