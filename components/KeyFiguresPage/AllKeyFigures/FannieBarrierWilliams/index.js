        <p>Civil rights activist and suffragist <SearchTag label='Frances "Fannie" Barrier Williams' tag="blackwomensuffrage_fannie_barrier_williams"/> was born in the western New York town of Brockport in 1855. Her family was one of the few Black families in the area. Her father was a successful businessman, homeowner and active in town affairs. The entire family was active in Brockport's First Baptist Church, of which they were the only Black members and where Barrier often sang and played the piano. As a child, she attended Brockport public schools, and in 1870, she became the first African-American graduate of the teacher training college Brockport State Normal School, which is now SUNY Brockport.</p>
        <p>After graduation, she taught at several schools for freedmen in the South and experienced intense racial discrimination for the first time in her life. Unsettled by the realities of life in the Jim Crow-era South, she returned north, studying portrait painting in Washington, D.C. and music at Boston's New England Conservatory of Music.</p>
